In support of this mission, the Soft DAO aims to: steward on-chain smart contracts and libraries, support core teams, and manage the treasury. \r\n\r\nThe Soft DAO defines high-integrity protocols and crypto assets as those embodying the following values: Rebel Reasonably, Trust Code, Build, and Do It Right.\r\n\r\nThe SOFT token was adopted by the Soft DAO as its governance token (https://forum.softdao.ch/t/update-vote-a-soft-token/1427). Governance will occur through a proposal and voting process. Proposals are limited to the following scope: meta-governance and mechanics, stewarding on-chain primitives, and supporting core teams.\r\n\r\nAt genesis, Soft DAOâ€™s smart contract primitives include the following:\r\n#1-Sales: configurable in-grouping.\r\n-Access: public or private, determined by blockchain addresses included in a Merkle root\r\n-Fair Surge Protection: order of access to on-chain activities determined by fair and random ordering to maintain low network fees\r\n-Transparency: group information and configurable attributes are visible on-chain\r\n-Non-custodial: tokens held directly in the smart contracts with configurable directions\r\n#2-Distributions: configurable escrow contracts.\r\n-Time-based lockups \u0026 vesting\r\n-Tranche-based vesting (unlock schedule)\r\n-Continuous vesting (start, cliff, end)\r\n-Price-based vesting (unlock schedule based on reference asset prices)\r\n\r\n#3-Governance: governor contract for DAO tooling.\r\n-Enables votes by token holders while tokens are vesting\r\n-Increased voting weights for tokens locked in genesis vesting
