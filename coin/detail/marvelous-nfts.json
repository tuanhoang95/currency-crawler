These characters can be fused together to produce unique player-built battle decks, which can be used in the battle arenas.\r\n\r\nThe Bad Days ecosystem also has its own unique process, known as Fusion. There are two types of Fusion. First is the process of transferring superpowers from one character to another, permanently locking to the character creating a customised and unique NFT character asset. Second is the process of leveling up rarity and power grid attributes. The second process requires a Bad Days Character (BDC) to be burnt, thus reducing the (BDC) supply.\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Marvelous NFTs (Bad Days)?\r\n\r\nBad Days was created in 2020 by Marvelous NFTs — a technology and art-focused game studio co-founded by Damian Rolvink and David Palmer.\r\n\r\nDamian Rolvink is the current CEO of the platform. Damian has accumulated over 20 years of experience in engineering and project management, specialising in government-funded projects. Being a gaming enthusiast and an early adopter of blockchain starting back in 2014, Damian found himself particularly interested in blockchain gaming and the NFT space, inspiring him to create this project.\r\n\r\nDavid Palmer is the current COO and Co-Founder of Marvelous NFTs. David has 25 years of experience as a supervisor and manager of teams, holding the position of Lead Supervisor for a construction company. David was first introduced to the space with day trading crypto and soon enjoyed the opportunity to engage with the industry full time. In 2018, David started producing promotional and marketing videos for a diverse range of blockchain projects and companies, establishing an extensive network of project leaders and team contacts. Being particularly enthused about NFT gaming projects, exploit testing, and assisting Alpha and Beta processes, along with being an avid collector of Marvel comics and memorabilia for many years, accumulating over 20,000 NFTs himself, co-founding Marvelous NFTs was a natural evolution for him.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Bad Days Unique?\r\n\r\nEach Bad Days character (BDC) possesses upgradable attribute power grids, and each character has its own set of superpower battle moves; the fusion process allows owners to customise their Bad Days Characters (BDC) superpowers producing a variety of strategic battle options and unique builds among Bad Days Characters (BDC), with the frequent addition of new character sets and Battle Cards (BC) an owner can fuse new additional Battle Cards (BC) and create powerful characters. Characters are classed into 6 elements, including - Cosmic, Gravity, Invulnerability, Teleportation, Lifeforce, and Telekinesis, each providing environment and battle advantages.\r\n\r\nMNFT token holders will soon be able to stake their LP tokens to receive regular rewards.\r\n\r\nHow Many Marvelous NFTs (MNFT) Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nMarvelous NFTs (MNFT) tokens have a total supply of 275 million tokens.
