Diva is a decentralized platform in which decision making power is held its participants, including Stakers and Operators.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, Lido is operated by a whitelisted set of ~30 Node Operators, which are permissioned and uncollateralized. This is commonly referred to as \"Proof of Authority\".\r\n\r\n** History of your project.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Diva came to life 2022, the project was founded by an experienced team of Cryptographers and participants of the Ethereum ecosystem. The project was funded late 2022. Testnet has been launched in summer 2023 and the mainnet launch of the protocol will happen late 2023.\r\n\r\n** What‚Äôs next for your project?\r\n\r\nThe protocol mainnet launch later this year (the Diva Dao is already live on mainnet). \r\n\r\n** What can your token be used for?\r\n\r\nThe Diva Token is intended for governance of the Diva DAO.
