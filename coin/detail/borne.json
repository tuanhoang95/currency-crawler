Monsters can be battled, and collected through gameplay, then fed items and crops that come from farming and crafting.\r\n\r\nSpellborne takes the best of Pokemon, Tamagotchi and Stardew Valley, creating an ecosystem where markets for monsters, in-game resources and cosmetics are open and controlled by players, making it distinct from existing titles. Humans have a nature of collecting things and building a relationship with them, Spellborne deeply explores this philosophy with its trust systems and decision based quest design.\r\n\r\n","zh":"","zh-tw":"","de":"","fr":"","es":"","ja":"","id":"","ru":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","vi":"","it":"","pl":"","tr":"","hu":"","nl":"","ro":"","sv":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":"","pt":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.spellborne.gg"],"whitepaper":"https://whitepaper.spellborne.gg/","blockchain_site":["https://snowscan.xyz/token/0x133879524ddb38582cf0b93d10adb789601ff397","https://etherscan.io/token/0x2a7f6a311cf835ebb16b7e954b8aacbb61ea149e","https://abscan.org/token/0xcfd7cfeacc783a0d48ce076922b9d87aab2c4c1b","https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/address/0x133879524ddb38582cf0b93d10adb789601ff397/token","https://snowtrace.io/token/0x133879524ddb38582cf0b93d10adb789601ff397/token?type=erc20\u0026chainid=43114","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x2a7f6a311cf835ebb16b7e954b8aacbb61ea149e"],"official_forum_url":["https://www.instagram.com/spellbornegame/","https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/defimons"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/spellborne"],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"spellbornegame","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68674/thumb/borne-token.png?1756231684","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68674/small/borne-token.png?1756231684","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68674/large/borne-token.png?1756231684"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x133879524ddb38582cf0b93d10adb789601ff397","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":100.0,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":0.0,"watchlist_portfolio_users":33,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"ath_date":{},"atl":{},"atl_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"atl_date":{},"market_cap":{},"market_cap_rank":null,"fully_diluted_valuation":{},"market_cap_fdv_ratio":null,"total_volume":{},"high_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"low_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"price_change_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_7d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_14d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_30
