This cryptocurrency is the brainchild of Peter Waterland who realised that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other such cryptocurrencies have no protection against future technology. It claims to be a “future-proof” cryptocurrency which enables transactions and decentralized communication while providing protection against classical as well as quantum computer attacks.\r\n\r\nThe Quantum Resistant Ledger company was founded by Peter Waterland, who found that Bitcoin, as well as Ethereum signatures are susceptible to attacks by powerful quantum computers. His research on quantum computers and signature programs let to the development of this new cryptocurrency, designed to be resistant to the present classical attacks as well as any future quantum computer attacks. Their team is made up of a diverse range of members spread out across the world, including developers (core, blockchain, mobile developers, etc.), analysts, advisors, marketing managers, designers and more.\r\n\r\nQuantum Resistant Ledger is the first ever cryptocurrency and the only one in existence as of August 2018, to consider the threat that the future technology of quantum computing poses to cryptocurrencies and their working. It uses a technology specifically designed for post-quantum security, called XMSS, which makes it secure against powerful quantum computers even while using a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Security against cyber-attacks is a very serious concern in this digital age, especially when you have digital assets whose loss is likely to lead you to bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nQRL is the first blockchain technology that provides durability and stability through resistance to quantum computer attacks. The encryption methods used by modern blockchains can become vulnerable to quantum computers over the next ten years. QRL tries to create a blockchain with long-term stability. By using blockchain technology, the QRL platform creates a “ledger” that generates hashes in such a way that it is virtually impenetrable to any type of computer attack.","de":"","es":"","fr":"","it":"","pl":"","ro":"","hu":"","nl":"","pt":"","sv":"","vi":"","tr":"","ru":"","ja":"","zh":"","zh-tw":"","ko":"퀀텀리지스턴트렛저(QRL)는 Quantum Computing이 향후 암호화 화폐에 제기할 위협에 대처하는 최초의 미래형 차세대 가치 저장장치 및 분산형 통신 플랫폼입니다.","ar":"","th":"","id":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.theqrl.org"],"whitepaper":"https://github.com/theQRL/Whitepaper/blob/master/QRL_whitepaper.pdf","blockchain_site":["https://explorer.theqrl.org/"],"official_forum_url":[],"chat_url":["https://www.facebook.com/theqrl/","https://www.theqrl.org/discord"],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1730273,"telegram_channel_identifier":"QRLedgerOfficial","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/qrl","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/theQRL/QRL","https://github.com/theQRL/theqrl.org","https://github.com/theQRL/qips","https://github.com/theQRL/zeus","https://github.com/theQRL/zond"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/700/thumb/yellow-black.512x512.png?1696501888","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/700/small/yellow-black.512x512.png?1696501888","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/700/large/yellow-black.512x512.png?1696501888"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":"2018-06-26","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":83.33,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":16.67,"ico_data":{"ico_start_date":"2017-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","ico_end_date":"2017-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","short_desc":"A ‘future proof’ blockchain","description":"The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) project is a public blockchain ledger designed to be specifically secure against quantum computing (QC) advances. Unlike existing ledgers, such as bitcoin or ethereum, the QRL is specially designed to use a form of post-quantum secure signature for transactions called XMSS.The QRL also uses a low power proof-of-stake (POS) algorithm which again utilises iterative hash-chains and provably secure hash-based pseudo random number functions. The POS algorithm is designed to have zero reliance upon conventional signatures which are vulnerable to a sufficiently powerful QC and allows nodes to run on low power devices such as raspberry PI’s or laptops and passively earn income by
