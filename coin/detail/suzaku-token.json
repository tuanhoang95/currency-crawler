Avalanche also caters to developers who wish to build their own blockchain networks for scalability, sovereignty, or regulatory reasons.\r\n\r\nEach Avalanche chain (simply called “Avalanche L1”) is fully sovereign with its independent consensus and data layers, and specific security model, while remaining natively interoperable with other L1s of the Avalanche ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSuzaku positions itself as the go-to protocol to help new L1s with all these challenging questions. In order to understand what they do, we should first briefly touch upon liquid staking through LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) and restaking.\r\n\r\nIn a simplified version, restaking is a powerful concept, where new L1s can “borrow” security from established networks in exchange for some rewards for validators. For L1s launching on Suzaku, this means the following benefits:\r\n\r\n- Solving the cold-start problem. New projects will struggle to attract enough validators to secure their network at launch. Restaking allows them to leverage existing stake on other networks. This provides them with immediate cryptoeconomic security without needing to bootstrap their own from scratch.\r\n- Increased gains for (re)stakers. Users can restake their tokens to secure multiple L1s, earning an APY from each of these. This increases the % amount one can make from their assets.\r\n\r\nLSTs are tokenised representations of staked assets. You can think of them as tokenised receipts that confirm your stake, but also allow you to further use this receipt in DeFi. And besides the better capital efficiency, there’s another important aspect - simplicity. Staking itself is usually somewhat of a complex process for beginners, but getting your hands on an LST is as easy as buying any other token.\r\n\r\nThe new L1 benefits from this service in multiple ways. The fact that the LSTs allow for much greater capital efficiency, they act as a powerful catalyst for broader participation. This indirectly supports decentralization by encouraging broader participation in staking. If there is also sufficient liquidity on the LST, users can also efficiently exit their position instantaneously on the secondary markets, further increasing their appeal.\r\n\r\nIn essence, Suzaku is an automated marketplace to connect Avalanche validators with new Avalanche sovereign L1s, while boosting yields for stakers.","zh":"","zh-tw":"","de":"","fr":"","es":"","ja":"","id":"","ru":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","vi":"","it":"","pl":"","tr":"","hu":"","nl":"","ro":"","sv":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":"","pt":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.suzaku.network"],"whitepaper":"","blockchain_site":["https://snowscan.xyz/address/0x451532F1C9eb7E4Dc2d493dB52b682C0Acf6F5EF","https://snowtrace.io/address/0x451532F1C9eb7E4Dc2d493dB52b682C0Acf6F5EF","https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/address/0x451532F1C9eb7E4Dc2d493dB52b682C0Acf6F5EF/token"],"official_forum_url":[],"chat_url":[],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"SuzakuNetwork","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/suzaku-network/"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68103/thumb/suzaku-logo-black-200.png?1754802307","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68103/small/suzaku-logo-black-200.png?1754802307","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68103/large/suzaku-logo-black-200.png?1754802307"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x451532f1c9eb7e4dc2d493db52b682c0acf6f5ef","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":2,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"ath_date":{},"atl":{},"atl_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"atl_date":{},"market_cap":{},"market_cap_rank":null,"fully_diluted_valuation":{},"market_cap_fdv_ratio":null,"total_volume":{},"high_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"low_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"price_change_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_7d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_14d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_30d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_60d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_200d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_1y":0.0,"market_cap_change_24h":null,"market_cap_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_1h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_7d_in_currency":{},"pri
