This interoperability broadens the reach of the platform and makes it accessible to a wider audience.\r\n\r\nRewards for Contributors: Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms where contributors often receive only the product or service they funded, Givestation rewards contributors with a BuidlPoints and other tokens for funding projects. This incentivizes users to actively engage in public goods, fostering a vibrant and supportive community.\r\n\r\nWeb3 Integration: Givestation fully embraces the Web3 ecosystem, providing users with a seamless and decentralized experience. Users have control over their funds, access to transparent smart contract interactions, and the ability to track their contributions on the blockchain.\r\n\r\nHistory of the Project:\r\nGivestation was conceived in late 2020 in response to the growing demand for decentralized crowdfunding solutions within the Web3 space. The project was initiated by a team of blockchain enthusiasts and developers who recognized the need for a platform that combined the benefits of blockchain technology, crowdfunding, and community engagement. Getting grants from some grant programs(Gitcoin grants and Optimism RPGF), since its inception, Givestation has undergone rigorous development, testing, and refinement to ensure a secure and user-friendly experience.\r\n\r\nWhat's Next for Givestation:\r\nThe future of Givestation holds exciting developments and expansion plans. Some potential directions for the project may include:\r\n\r\nCross-Chain Compatibility: Expanding support for additional blockchain networks to provide users with even more choices and flexibility when participating in crowdfunding projects.\r\n\r\nGovernance Mechanisms: Implementing decentralized governance mechanisms, allowing token holders to have a say in platform decisions, such as project approvals and protocol upgrades.\r\n\r\nCommunity Growth: Continuing to build a strong and engaged user community by fostering partnerships, hosting events, and incentivizing contributions.\r\n\r\nToken Utility:\r\nThe native token of Givestation (GVST) serves multiple purposes within the ecosystem:\r\n\r\nStaking: Token holders can stake their tokens to earn rewards, providing an additional incentive to participate in the platform.\r\n\r\nCampaign Contributions: Users can use the token to fund projects and campaigns on the platform.\r\n\r\nGovernance: Token holders may have voting rights to influence platform decisions and proposals.\r\n\r\nRewards: Users receive tokens as rewards for contributing to campaigns, which can be traded on various exchanges or held for potential future gains.\r\n\r\n","de":"","es":"","fr":"","it":"","pl":"","ro":"","hu":"","nl":"","pt":"","sv":"","vi":"","tr":"","ru":"","ja":"","zh":"","zh-tw":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","id":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://givestation.org/","https://youbuidl.dev/projects"],"whitepaper":"https://givestation.gitbook.io/","blockchain_site":[],"official_forum_url":["https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/Givestation","https://snapshot.org/#/givestation.eth"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/givestation","https://medium.com/GiveStation"],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"GiveStation","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/givestation"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/31715/thumb/logogivestation.jpg?1696530537","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/31715/small/logogivestation.jpg?1696530537","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/31715/large/logogivestation.jpg?1696530537"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":201,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"ath_date":{},"atl":{},"atl_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"atl_date":{},"market_cap":{},"market_cap_rank":null,"fully_diluted_valuation":{},"market_cap_fdv_ratio":null,"total_volume":{},"high_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"low_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"price_change_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_7d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_14d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_30d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_60d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_200d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_1y":0.0,"market_cap_change_24h":null,"market_cap_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_1h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_7d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_14d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_30d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage
