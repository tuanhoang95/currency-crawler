SOLA-X has developed flexible and dynamic liquidity pools that enable multiple assets within a pool or features such as unilateral liquidity provisioning, intra-platform liquidity aggregation, and intelligent liquidity management. Furthermore, SOLA-X connects Solana to the most popular EVM ecosystems such as Ethereum, Binance Chain, and Polygon.\r\n\r\nWhich pain point does SOLA-X solve?\r\nProviding liquidity to multiple liquidity pools and monitoring them as well as rebalancing liquidity allocations in a way to maximize the APY and reduce downside risks like impermanent loss is a difficult task. \r\nSOLA-X solves these pain points liquidity providers are facing using traditional AMMs like Uniswap. Due to SOLA-Xâ€™s AMM architecture and protocol-managed liquidity, a liquidity provider does not have to monitor and rebalance single liquidity pool allocations. Within SOLA-X, a feature called smart liquidity manages the liquidity in a way that single pool risks are minimized and the realized APY is the highest possible. A user only has to deposit one single asset in order to provide liquidity to multiple pools.\r\n\r\nFacts\r\nðŸ”¸7,000 + people community \r\nðŸ”¸Platform launch in November 30.\r\nðŸ”¸TGE in Q1 2023\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nðŸ”¸Frankfurt School of Finance and Management (strategic partnership) \r\nðŸ”¸Solana Prime (advisory \u0026 launchpad) \r\nðŸ”¸GEM Digital (funding)\r\nðŸ”¸vt3 Ventures (funding)\r\nðŸ”¸Lithium (launchpad)\r\nðŸ”¸consola finance (swap integration)\r\nðŸ”¸Handelsblatt (Innovation award winner 2022)\r\n\r\nTeam\r\nWe are an anonymous, but very experienced team.
