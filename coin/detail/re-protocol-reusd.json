The protocol’s two deposit tokens—reUSD and reUSDe—let users choose between a principal-protected, fixed-yield product (reUSD, RF + 250 bps) or a risk-bearing, variable-yield option (reUSDe, up to ~23 % APR). Built on Ethereum, Avalanch, Arbitrum and Base, Re Protocol leverages decentralized underwriting pools to generate transparent, market-driven insurance returns. Governance and treasury functions are overseen by the Cayman-based Re Foundation to ensure regulatory compliance and capital efficiency. With integrations into DeFi ecosystems like Curve, Pendle, and Ethena, Re Protocol bridges traditional reinsurance markets and DeFi—opening institutional-grade risk diversification to crypto investors.","de":"","es":"","fr":"","it":"","pl":"","ro":"","hu":"","nl":"","pt":"","sv":"","vi":"","tr":"","ru":"","ja":"","zh":"","zh-tw":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","id":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://re.xyz"],"whitepaper":"https://docs.re.xyz","blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/address/0x5086bf358635b81d8c47c66d1c8b9e567db70c72","https://snowtrace.io/token/0x180aF87b47Bf272B2df59dccf2D76a6eaFa625Bf?chainid=43114","https://arbiscan.io/address/0x76cE01F0Ef25AA66cC5F1E546a005e4A63B25609","https://basescan.org/token/0x7D214438D0F27AfCcC23B3d1e1a53906aCE5CFEa","https://etherscan.io/token/0x5086bf358635b81d8c47c66d1c8b9e567db70c72","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x5086bf358635b81d8c47c66d1c8b9e567db70c72","https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/address/0x180af87b47bf272b2df59dccf2d76a6eafa625bf/token","https://arbiscan.io/token/0x76ce01f0ef25aa66cc5f1e546a005e4a63b25609"],"official_forum_url":[],"chat_url":[],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"re","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"re_protocol","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/66291/thumb/Points_Program_Group_91.png?1749676055","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/66291/small/Points_Program_Group_91.png?1749676055","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/66291/large/Points_Program_Group_91.png?1749676055"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x5086bf358635b81d8c47c66d1c8b9e567db70c72","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":3,"market_cap_rank":10214,"market_data":{"current_price":{"aed":3.64,"ars":1272.78,"aud":1.52,"bch":0.00194529,"bdt":120.11,"bhd":0.373736,"bmd":0.989719,"bnb":0.00135559,"brl":5.52,"btc":8.38e-06,"cad":1.36,"chf":0.794328,"clp":953.61,"cny":7.1,"czk":20.98,"dkk":6.36,"dot":0.23193956,"eos":1.678123,"eth":0.00027795,"eur":0.851109,"gbp":0.73788,"gel":2.68,"hkd":7.77,"huf":339.7,"idr":16160.37,"ils":3.32,"inr":85.26,"jpy":147.28,"krw":1376.9,"kwd":0.302498,"lkr":298.48,"ltc":0.00970068,"mmk":2076.43,"mxn":18.56,"myr":4.2,"ngn":1515.23,"nok":10.08,"nzd":1.66,"php":56.52,"pkr":282.0,"pln":3.61,"rub":77.72,"sar":3.71,"sek":9.57,"sgd":1.27,"sol":0.00562097,"thb":32.07,"try":39.96,"twd":29.11,"uah":41.32,"usd":0.989719,"vef":0.099101,"vnd":25892,"xag":0.02589261,"xau":0.00029539,"xdr":0.694564,"xlm":2.13519,"xrp":0.2871288,"yfi":0.00016466,"zar":17.53,"bits":8.38,"link":0.05537519,"sats":837.84},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{"aed":3.72,"ars":1279.57,"aud":1.56,"bch":0.00216043,"bdt":124.25,"bhd":0.381898,"bmd":1.012,"bnb":0.00157924,"brl":5.6,"btc":9.66e-06,"cad":1.39,"chf":0.82336,"clp":970.3,"cny":7.26,"czk":21.74,"dkk":6.53,"dot":0.30791533,"eos":2.127473,"eth":0.00042164,"eur":0.875845,"gbp":0.749204,"gel":2.75,"hkd":7.95,"huf":353.78,"idr":16494.46,"ils":3.54,"inr":87.13,"jpy":148.77,"krw":1395.13,"kwd":0.309613,"lkr":303.93,"ltc":0.01221127,"mmk":2124.09,"mxn":19.13,"myr":4.29,"ngn":1567.14,"nok":10.34,"nzd":1.69,"php":57.62,"pkr":287.7,"pln":3.75,"rub":79.98,"sar":3.8,"sek":9.77,"sgd":1.29,"sol":0.00733309,"thb":33.0,"try":40.43,"twd":29.82,"uah":42.29,"usd":1.012,"vef":0.101375,"vnd":26479,"xag":0.02815209,"xau":0.00030975,"xdr":0.7632,"xlm":4.513708,"xrp":0.48698356,"yfi":0.0002061,"zar":18.22,"bits":9.66,"link":0.07905499,"sats":965.66},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":-2.23014,"ars":-0.53043,"aud":-2.28819,"bch":-9.95819,"bdt":-3.33672,"bhd":-2.13732,"bmd":-2.24358,"bnb":-14.16225,"brl":-1.44252,"btc":-13.2369,"cad":-1.91865,"chf":-3.52596,"clp":-1.72008,"cny":-2.16384,"czk":-3.5055,"dkk":-2.70792,"dot":-24.67424,"eos":-21.12132,"eth":-34.07883,"eur":-2.82426,"gbp":-1.51156,"gel":-2.60298,"hkd":-2.27266,"huf":-3.97858,"idr":-2.02545,"ils":-6.0392,"inr":-2.14908,"jpy":-1.00159,"krw":-1.30681,"kwd":-2.29824,"lkr":-1.79144,"ltc":-20.55961,"mmk":-2.24358,"mxn":-2.96407,"myr":-2.11442,"ngn":-3.31216,"nok":-2.45608,"nzd":-1.84152,"php":-1.90032,"pkr":-1.98365,"pln":-3.49109,"rub":-2.82491,"sar":-2.22742,"sek":-2.07807,"sgd":-1.76624,"sol":-23.34788,"thb":-2.82688,"try":-1.1647,"twd":-2.40316,"uah":-2.30599,"usd":-2.24358,"vef":-2.24358,"vnd":-2.21886,"xag":-8.02596,"xau":-4.63563,"xdr":-8.99325,"xlm":-52.69544,"xrp":-41.03932,"yfi":-20.10717,"zar":-3.81622,"bits":-13.2369,"link":-29.95358,"sats":-13.2369},"ath_date":{"aed":"2025-06-27T05:16:09.652Z","ars":"2025-07-15T14:19:19.477Z","aud":"2025-07-07T18:35:15.825Z","bch":"2025-06-18T11:01:36.521Z","bdt":"2025-07-04T09:09:18.259Z","bhd":"2025-06-27T05:16:09.652Z","bmd":"2025-06-27T05:16:09.652Z","bnb":"2025-06-27T01:10:12.794Z","brl":"2025-06-26T11:50:14.521Z","btc":"2025-06-18T10:55:32.627Z","cad":"2025-06-27T18:10:15.136Z","
