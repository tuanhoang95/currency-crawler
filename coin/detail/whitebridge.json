At its core, WhiteBridge AI Agents Network transforms fragmented and online data into actionable, authentic insights, offering unparalleled clarity in an increasingly complex digital world.\r\n\r\nThe Challenge\r\n\r\nIn an era where personal information is scattered across countless digital platforms, traditional search engines struggle to aggregate meaningful, authentic insights about individuals. WhiteBridge AI Agents Network tackles this challenge head-on. By integrating multiple global data sources—such as court records, vehicle registrations, company directories, property registries, and social media footprints—our decentralized infrastructure creates a unified people-data search engine and intelligence layer.\r\n\r\nAI Agents\r\n\r\nThese advanced agents are the platform's intelligence layer, designed to address diverse use cases such as reputation management, digital footprint analysis, background checks, and compliance monitoring. They operate seamlessly by querying a decentralized network of global data providers to deliver real-time, structured reports tailored to user needs.\r\n\r\nDePIN Backbone\r\n\r\nWhiteBridge AI Agents Network functions as a Decentralized Digital Identity Network (DeDIN) and serves as the backbone for a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN). It aggregates raw data from authoritative sources and transforms it into structured, verified digital identities. These identities underpin AI-powered agents designed to address diverse applications, including personal reputation monitoring, authenticity verification, in-depth business due diligence, and trust scoring for influencers (KOLs). By enabling trust and interoperability across DePIN ecosystems through its DeDIN backbone, WhiteBridge AI Agents Network ensures the data driving these AI agents is secure, globally inclusive, and privacy-preserving, providing reliable insights across various industries.\r\n\r\nToken-Driven Ecosystem\r\n\r\nWhiteBridge’s token-driven economy incentivizes nodes (data providers) to connect their data sets to the network. Every time an AI agent queries the network, revenues are generated and converted via the protocol’s smart contracts to reward data providers proportionally. This economic loop encourages more data integration, creating a self-sustaining loop that enriches the network over time, enriching the search engine’s intelligence capabilities, while also driving demand for WhiteBridge’s native token.\r\n","de":"","es":"","fr":"","it":"","pl":"","ro":"","hu":"","nl":"","pt":"","sv":"","vi":"","tr":"","ru":"","ja":"","zh":"","zh-tw":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","id":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://whitebridge.network/"],"whitepaper":"","blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/token/0x635d44F246156ed1080CB470877256c847673f19","https://binplorer.com/address/0x635d44F246156ed1080CB470877256c847673f19"],"official_forum_url":[],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/whitebridge"],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"AiWhitebridge","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"whitebridgeai","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/WhiteBridge-AI/WBAI_Token"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/53713/thumb/WB_BLACK_ICON_LOGO.png?1737093242","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/53713/small/WB_BLACK_ICON_LOGO.png?1737093242","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/53713/large/WB_BLACK_ICON_LOGO.png?1737093242"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x635d44f246156ed1080cb470877256c847673f19","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":26,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"ath_date":{},"atl":{},"atl_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"atl_date":{},"market_cap":{},"market_cap_rank":null,"fully_diluted_valuation":{},"market_cap_fdv_ratio":null,"total_volume":{},"high_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"low_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"price_change_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_7d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_14d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_30d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_60d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_200d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_1y":0.0,"market_cap_change_24h":null,"market_cap_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_1h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_7d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_14d_in_cu
