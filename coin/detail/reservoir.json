The importance for a decentralized, scalable, efficient, and yield-bearing stablecoin has never been more clear and necessary to onboard and cross-collateralize the next $1T of assets.\r\n\r\nReservoir is a permissionless protocol on Ethereum with native integration on top-tier networks, offering users a widely accessible next-gen stablecoin, rUSD, a liquid yielding asset, srUSD, a term based yielding asset, trUSD, and permissionless lending markets.\r\n\r\nThe protocol is backed by multiple digital and real world assets - providing the most scalable stablecoin through DeFi applications and real world asset integrations. Bull market or bear market, Reservoir can offer better and consistent yields than other stablecoin protocols. Relative to peers, the underlying assets powering Reservoir products are less volatile, of higher quality, and offer greater diversification.","zh":"","zh-tw":"","de":"","fr":"","es":"","ja":"","id":"","ru":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","vi":"","it":"","pl":"","tr":"","hu":"","nl":"","ro":"","sv":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":"","pt":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://app.reservoir.xyz/"],"whitepaper":"https://docs.reservoir.xyz/","blockchain_site":[],"official_forum_url":["https://reservoir.beehiiv.com/","https://discord.com/invite/reservoir"],"chat_url":[],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"reservoir_xyz","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68267/thumb/dam.png?1755228740","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68267/small/dam.png?1755228740","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68267/large/dam.png?1755228740"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":1,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"ath_date":{},"atl":{},"atl_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"atl_date":{},"market_cap":{},"market_cap_rank":null,"fully_diluted_valuation":{},"market_cap_fdv_ratio":null,"total_volume":{},"high_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"low_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"price_change_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_7d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_14d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_30d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_60d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_200d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_1y":0.0,"market_cap_change_24h":null,"market_cap_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_1h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_7d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_14d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_30d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_60d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_200d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_1y_in_currency":{},"market_cap_change_24h_in_currency":{},"market_cap_change_percentage_24h_
