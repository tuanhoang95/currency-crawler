So, for every 1 XDEFI token staked, the staker receives 1 vXDEFI token in return.\r\n\r\nvXDEFI represents the stakerâ€™s percentage ownership of the entire vault receiving the rewards in XDEFI coming from the fees collected by XDEFI.\r\n\r\nThere is no lock-up period and rewards will auto-compound until stakers decide to convert their vXDEFI back into XDEFI tokens.\r\n\r\nvXDEFI tokens can also be used to vote on XDEFI community proposals via
