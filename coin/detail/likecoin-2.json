Content creators can record the data and guarantee its integrity using LikeCoin's content registry protocol,\r\nISCN (International Standard Content Number).\r\n\r\nThe ISCN functions like an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) for digital content; this unique, immutable content identifier contains metadata including timestamp, author, title, publisher, licensing, and versions. At its core, content metadata will be registered in the LikeCoin public blockchain and link to decentralized storage solutions like the IPFS or Arweave for storing and serving ISCN-linked content.\r\n\r\nLikeCoin provides publication related SDK/plugins that can integrate with publication platforms like news media, social media and blogging websites. Currently, there are more than 1,600 media sites integrated with LikeCoin, onboarded 112,068 registered Likers, 20,060 creators and produced 625,250 content in the LikeCoin network.
