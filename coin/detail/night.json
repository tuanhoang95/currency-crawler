The Midnight protocol combines the use of a ZK proofs-based, public-private dual-state ledger architecture to protect data, with a composite, dual-component tokenomics design to protect metadata.*\r\n\r\n*NB 1: We are requesting to have NIGHT (Midnight’s unshielded utility token) listed on crypto exchanges. For the avoidance of doubt, NIGHT has no privacy features. DUST, which is a shielded resource and enables some of the chain's privacy enhancing features, is not part of this listing application.*\r\n\r\n*NB 2: We are requesting that only c-NIGHT (the Cardano Native Asset representation of NIGHT) be listed on exchanges. We are not requesting the listing of m-NIGHT (the representation of NIGHT on the Midnight Layer 1 chain). This approach minimizes integration complexity, especially for exchanges that already support Cardano Native Assets.*\r\n\r\n*We have published a detailed tokenomics which details our ground breaking new blockchain technology in more detail here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GJL-XWCv2FeHVv6INTKLGanKS_pbCb9w/view?usp=drive_link\r\n\r\n*Further, our MICA whitepaper which received a no-objection
