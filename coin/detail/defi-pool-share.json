From targeted marketing to strategic partnerships, we're here to attract liquidity providers, borrowers, and DeFi enthusiasts to our community. Our plan is diverse, leveraging unique strengths while prioritizing security, transparency, and user-centricity.\r\n\r\nPhase 1: Empowering the DeFi Community\r\n\r\nIn this phase, we empower the DeFi community by deploying liquidity and offering Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) exclusive access to borrow LP positions at incredible discounts. This innovative approach invites KOLs to explore DeFi Pool Share, generating substantial revenue from borrowed LP positions.\r\n\r\nWe're also igniting the power of automated marketing to amplify our presence. KOLs, as passionate advocates, drive the platform's growth organically.\r\n\r\nCollaboration with start-ups is a key strategy. By onboarding innovative start-ups, we supercharge liquidity, making DeFi Pool Share an attractive choice for borrowers and liquidity providers.\"\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\"Phase 2: Pioneering Fractional LP Position Borrowing\r\n\r\nPhase 2 brings innovation to the forefront with fractional LP position borrowing. Users can now borrow parts of LP positions, making it more accessible and cost-effective.\r\n\r\nFractional borrowing expands our user base, welcoming retail users to the DeFi ecosystem.\r\n\r\nWe aim to democratize DeFi, offering efficient lending and borrowing opportunities to all.\"\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\"Phase 3: Empowering Institutional Adoption and Blue-Chip Partnerships\r\n\r\nOur final phase focuses on advanced features and strong partnerships with institutions and blue-chip projects.\r\n\r\nCutting-edge features cater to institutional participants, offering sophisticated tools for risk management and asset optimization.\r\n\r\nStrategic partnerships amplify our visibility and strengthen industry connections.\r\n\r\nSecurity and compliance take center stage, ensuring a safe and trustworthy platform.\"\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nGovernance: DPST holders can participate in the governance of the DeFi Pool Share platform by voting on proposals related to changes in the lending fee structure, the addition of new features or services, and other important decisions\r\nPremium access: DPST holders can also access premium features and services such as discounted lending fees \u0026 priority access to new pools.\r\nStaking: DPST holders that stake their share will also be eligible to receive a portion of the platform's revenue through a fee-sharing mechanism. This mechanism will distribute a portion of the platform's revenue to DPST stakers, providing a potentially significant source of passive income for long-term token holders.\r\nRewards: In order to provide an incentive for early adoption and liquidity provision, the DeFi Pool Share platform will distribute 5% of the total supply of DPST tokens to early adopters and liquidity providers through a reward system. This will help to bootstrap liquidity and adoption of the platform in the early stages of its development.\r\n","de":"","es":"","fr":"","it":"","pl":"","ro":"","hu":"","nl":"","pt":"","sv":"","vi":"","tr":"","ru":"","ja":"","zh":"","zh-tw":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","id":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://defipoolshare.io/","https://twitter.com/DefiPoolShare"],"whitepaper":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wnGfscMEmfNUlO-FAHJpklH3GJ08lbyd/view?usp=sharing","blockchain_site":[],"official_forum_url":["https://www.linkedin.com/company/defipoolshare/"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/J2e9tv4C","https://medium.com/@defipoolshare"],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"DefiPoolShare","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"defipoolshare","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/w0dm4n"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/31895/thumb/dsp_logo_2_%283%29.png?1696530706","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/31895/small/dsp_logo_2_%283%29.png?1696530706","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/31895/large/dsp_logo_2_%283%29.png?1696530706"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":15,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"ath_date":{},"atl":{},"atl_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"atl_date":{},"market_cap":{},"market_cap_rank":null,"fully_diluted_valuation":{},"market_cap_fdv_ratio":null,"total_volume":{},"high_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"low_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"price_change_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_7d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_14d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_30d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_60d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_200d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_1y":0.0,"market_cap_change_24h":null,"market_cap_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_1h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_7d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_14d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_30d_i
