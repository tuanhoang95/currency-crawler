Stablecoins also allow people from high inflation economies to store the value of their savings in an asset pegged to a more stable currency, like the U.S. dollar. By transferring QiUSD on the Qi Blockchain which acts as a secure network with low transaction fees the users incur very low slippage compared to traditional
