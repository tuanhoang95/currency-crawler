Asset nominal tokenization starts with the process of taking a data metric, such as Total Market Capitalization. This metric is then set to a divisor of 10,000,000,000. The new, nominal asset token value now trades in lockstep with the underlying data metric it tracks.\r\n\r\nCollateralizing the new smart contract against multiple assets like ETH or DAI provides the security that this new tokenized asset is backed by a set of rules and collateral enforced by an Ethereum smart contract, thereby tokenizing total market capitalization.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the total crypto market cap resides at 3.5 trillion dollars. We then add a divisor to that number, just like the S\u0026P 500 or any major financial index would. The price calculation for TCAP is as follows:\r\n\r\ncc = $3,500,000,000,000\r\n\r\ndd = 10,000,000,000\r\n\r\nrr = \\frac{c}{d} \r\nd\r\nc\r\nâ€‹\t\r\n  = $350.00\r\n\r\nWhere cc is the total cryptocurrency market cap, dd is the divisor and rr is the TCAP token price.\r\n\r\nTCAPs are then minted upon being collateralized by an underlying asset, such as ETH or DAI. What the user receives in return is a newly minted asset nominalized token that moves in real time to the penny of the underlying total market cap metric our TCAP Smart Contract is tracking. Each TCAP is algorithmically collateralized by a corresponding amount of ETH/ or DAI needed to appropriately back each token by \u003e200%, thus creating price exposure to the entire cryptocurrency sector with the single push of a button.\r\n\r\nHow to Use TCAP?\r\n\r\nMint TCAP: https://app.cryptex.finance/\r\n\r\nTrade TCAP:

investment community as one of the key metrics measuring the expansions and declines transpiring in the space, Total Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization has no means or ability to be minted in real-time form, until
