It uses a dual token design where XYO powers staking and ecosystem participation, and XL1 is the gas and reward token that runs the chain.\r\n\r\nXYO overall is a reality bridge. The network started by proving location and data origin with bound witness interactions between devices, then grew into a global DePIN with more than ten million nodes through the COIN app.\r\n\r\nXL1 is the native utility token used for\r\nPaying gas and transaction fees for all on chain activity. Activity can burn a portion of fees.\r\n\r\nPowering smart contracts, dApps, and validator rewards on XYO Layer One.\r\n\r\nIncentivizing participation through staking and step based rewards inside the protocol. \r\n\r\nBridging and wrapping for access on other chains when needed, for example WXL1.\r\n\r\nXYO tools include\r\nXL1 Wallet to hold and use XL1 with XYO Layer One.\r\n\r\nExplorer endpoints for testnet and mainnet as they go live. \r\n\r\nSDKs and APIs across mobile and server languages to plug real world data into apps.\r\n\r\nPublic docs and a tokenomics guide that explain the dual token model.\r\n\r\nHow many XL1 tokens are there\r\nAt TGE there are 38.3 billion XL1, with about 7.70 billion initially circulating, or roughly twenty percent, subject to the final listing day snapshot. Long term inflation is targeted around zero point seven percent per year after the early emission era, and base fee burns plus slashing can offset issuance over time. \r\n\r\nIllustrative allocation and unlocks place the majority toward network emissions for node operators, with team and investor tokens on delayed cliffs and long vesting. \r\n\r\nWhat makes the chain different\r\nProof of Origin and Proof of Location let devices attest to proximity and data lineage, so apps can trust where data came from and how it changed before it reaches a contract. These proofs are created at the edge with bound witness, then anchored on chain for integrity.\r\n\r\nThe architecture is built for high volume data. Step hashing and bound witness trees help compress and verify large flows, while the chain keeps a single shared ledger that supports parallelized work across apps. \r\n\r\nA little about XYO today\r\nThe XYO network has onboarded more than ten million nodes, mostly mobile users who contribute verified data and often enter crypto for the first time through COIN. That reach provides a ready funnel of participants and data for XYO Layer One.\r\n\r\nRoadmap and status\r\nXYO Layer One is live in testnet with public repos and docs available, with mainnet planned alongside the XL1 launch. Milestones include wallet releases, bridging, validator staking, and expanded SDK support. \r\n\r\nWhere can I get XL1\r\nThe team has communicated a target of September 16, 2025 for token generation and listings, with XL1 serving as the gas token of the chain. Until listings open, users interact on testnet and can stake XYO to position for ecosystem participation. Final listing details are set by exchanges.","zh":"","zh-tw":"","de":"","fr":"","es":"","ja":"","id":"","ru":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","vi":"","it":"","pl":"","tr":"","hu":"","nl":"","ro":"","sv":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":"","pt":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://xyo.network"],"whitepaper":"https://gitbook.xyo.network/xyo-layer-one/xyo-layer-one-white-paper-draft","blockchain_site":["https://explore.xyo.network/xl1","https://etherscan.io","https://solscan.io"],"official_forum_url":["https://www.linkedin.com/company/officialxyo","https://www.instagram.com/officialxyo"],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/officialxyo","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyZDqb9pgntVHJVt1pxXtsw"],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"OfficialXYO","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"official_xyo","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/xyoraclenetwork"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68691/thumb/XL1_Logo_Icon_Mainnet_200px.png?1756279973","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68691/small/XL1_Logo_Icon_Mainnet_200px.png?1756279973","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68691/large/XL1_Logo_Icon_Mainnet_200px.png?1756279973"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":3,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"ath_date":{},"atl":{},"atl_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"atl_date":{},"market_cap":{},"market_cap_rank":null,"fully_diluted_valuation":{},"market_cap_fdv_ratio":null,"total_volume":{},"high_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"low_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"price_change_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_7d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_14d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_30d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_60d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_200d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_1y":0.0,"market_cap_change_24h":null,"market_cap_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_1h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_24h_in_currency"
