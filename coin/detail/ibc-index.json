ION is the second token native to Osmosis, and ION stakers have the right to directly participate in the IBCX's operation through the ION DAO governance. That means people who are familiar with the Cosmos ecosystem govern the IBCX.\r\n\r\nHistory of your project.\r\n- Beginning with the ION 3.0 proposal, there have been many other proposals based on feedback and suggestions from the community, and we have built the product together with ION DAO based on the communications. As a result, we launched IBCX on May 17th on Osmosis.\r\n- https://commonwealth.im/ion/discussions\r\n- https://ion.wtf/governance/make\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s next for your project?\r\n- Our next stop is to launch liquid-staked IBCX with Stride in May, the leading liquid-staking provider in Cosmos. Furthermore, we are planning to bring further development that enables users to mint IBCX with ETH on Ethereum. IBCX's ultimate goal is to establish an easier process for newcomers on Cosmos to be onboarded.\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\n- IBCX doesn't offer use cases besides Mint/Burn at the moment, but after launching the features such as liquid-staked IBCX and cross-chain mint/swap, more use cases will come.\r\n","de":"","es":"","fr":"","it":"","pl":"","ro":"","hu":"","nl":"","pt":"","sv":"","vi":"","tr":"","ru":"","ja":"","zh":"","zh-tw":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","id":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://index.ion.wtf/mint"],"whitepaper":"","blockchain_site":["https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/account/osmo14klwqgkmackvx2tqa0trtg69dmy0nrg4ntq4gjgw2za4734r5seqjqm4gm","https://celatone.osmosis.zone/mainnet/contracts/osmo14klwqgkmackvx2tqa0trtg69dmy0nrg4ntq4gjgw2za4734r5seqjqm4gm"],"official_forum_url":["https://medium.com/@IBCindex","https://discord.gg/9gD5wDaZWU"],"chat_url":[],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"IBCindex","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"IONGovernanceWorkingGroup","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/many-things/ibcx-contracts"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/30543/thumb/IBCX_logo_symbol_flat_color.png?1696529415","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/30543/small/IBCX_logo_symbol_flat_color.png?1696529415","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/30543/large/IBCX_logo_symbol_flat_color.png?1696529415"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"osmo14klwqgkmackvx2tqa0trtg69dmy0nrg4ntq4gjgw2za4734r5seqjqm4gm","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":184,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{},"total_value_locked":{"btc":0.11001601,"usd":13024.08},"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":"-","fdv_to_tvl_ratio":"-","roi":null,"ath":{},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"ath_date":{},"atl":{},"atl_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"atl_date":{},"market_cap":{},"market_cap_rank":null,"fully_diluted_valuation":{},"market_cap_fdv_ratio":null,"total_volume":{},"high_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"low_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"price_change_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_7d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_14d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_30d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_60d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_200d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_1y":0.0,"market_cap_change_24h":null,"market_cap_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_24
