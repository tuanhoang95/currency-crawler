The example below illustrates how value accrues to the token assuming a staking yield of 3%.\r\n\r\nThe reETH on re.al functions the same as ETH on Ethereum mainnet or any other Ethereum L2, with the exception that it accrues value from staking. Gas fees, token swaps, asset payments done in ETH on other chains will be completed in reETH on re.al, processed at significantly lower costs to the L1 due to the processing efficiencies of an L2.\r\n\r\nThrough the deployment of reETH, all ETH on the chain, no matter where it's held, earns staking yield for users. This unlocks new design opportunities and DeFi primitives in the re.al ecosystem while helping users maximize the value of their assets.
