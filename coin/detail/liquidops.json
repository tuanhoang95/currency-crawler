The protocol enables users to deposit digital assets into liquidity pools to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral that exceeds the loan value.\r\n\r\nThe protocol operates using a pool-based lending system where lenders contribute assets to common pools rather than lending directly to individual borrowers. Users who supply assets receive oTokens, which are interest-bearing tokens that represent their lending position and automatically accrue interest from borrower fees. These oTokens can also serve as collateral for borrowing other supported assets.\r\n\r\nHow Does LiquidOps Work?\r\n\r\nLiquidOps utilizes a Jump Rate Interest Model that adjusts rates based on asset utilization within each pool. When utilization remains below a predetermined threshold, interest rates increase gradually. Once utilization exceeds this threshold, rates increase sharply to encourage additional deposits and discourage excessive borrowing.\r\n\r\nThe protocol employs overcollateralization requirements where borrowers must deposit assets exceeding the value of their loans. Risk management includes continuous monitoring of collateral ratios through price oracles and an auction-based liquidation system that activates when collateral values fall below liquidation thresholds.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes LiquidOps Unique?\r\n\r\nLiquidOps leverages Arweave's permanent storage capabilities, ensuring all transactions, loan histories, and liquidation events are stored permanently on the permaweb. Built on AO's parallel computing layer, the protocol's processes can operate autonomously, handling interest rate updates without external intervention.\r\n\r\nHow Many LQD Tokens Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nThe protocol uses LQD as its native governance token with a maximum supply of 50,000,000 tokens. Token distribution allocates 28% to DAO treasury management, 25% for liquidity mining rewards, 15% for the AO fair launch, 15% to founders and contributors, 10% to foundation activities, and 7% from private sales. LQD holders participate in protocol governance, including voting on protocol parameters, asset listings, and treasury decisions.\r\n\r\nDevelopment Timeline\r\n\r\nDevelopment milestones include securing $325,000 in pre-seed funding in September 2024, launching testnet in January 2025, deploying mainnet beta in March 2025, and conducting a fair launch in July 2025. The protocol attracted over 1,500 waitlist users collectively holding $50 million in liquidity before mainnet launch.\r\n\r\nWhere Can You Access LiquidOps?\r\n\r\nLiquidOps provides developer tools including a JavaScript SDK for programmatic interaction, comprehensive documentation for integration support, and native AO processes for autonomous operations. The protocol is accessible through a web interface at liquidops.io and can be integrated using the JavaScript SDK or direct interaction with AO processes.","zh":"","zh-tw":"","de":"","fr":"","es":"","ja":"","id":"","ru":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","vi":"","it":"","pl":"","tr":"","hu":"","nl":"","ro":"","sv":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":"","pt":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://liquidops.io","https://labs.liquidops.io"],"whitepaper":"https://docs.liquidops.io/","blockchain_site":["https://aoscan.arweave.net/#/process/n2MhPK0O3yEvY2zW73sqcmWqDktJxAifJDrri4qireI","https://www.ao.link/#/token/n2MhPK0O3yEvY2zW73sqcmWqDktJxAifJDrri4qireI"],"official_forum_url":["https://linktr.ee/LiquidOps","https://www.youtube.com/@Liquid_Ops","https://www.linkedin.com/company/liquid-ops/"],"chat_url":["https://medium.com/@liquidops","https://www.youtube.com/@Liquid_Ops"],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"Liquid_Ops","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"LiquidOps","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/useLiquidOps"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68799/thumb/LiquidOps.png?1756624771","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68799/small/LiquidOps.png?1756624771","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/68799/large/LiquidOps.png?1756624771"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":3,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"ath_date":{},"atl":{},"atl_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"atl_date":{},"market_cap":{},"market_cap_rank":null,"fully_diluted_valuation":{},"market_cap_fdv_ratio":null,"total_volume":{},"high_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"low_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"price_change_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_7d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_14d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_30d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_60d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_200d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_1y":0.0,"market_cap_change_24h":null,"market_cap_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_1h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_24h_in_currency":{
