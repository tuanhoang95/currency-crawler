With a strong emphasis on transparency and simplicity, PHP Coin aims to bring the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi) to a broader audience, particularly those who may be new to blockchain and cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nUnlike many existing blockchain solutions that may be intimidating for new users or come with high transaction fees, PHP Coin emphasizes ease of use and cost-efficiency. The project strives to offer fee less transactions, which makes it ideal for everyday users, as well as developers seeking straightforward blockchain solutions.\r\n\r\nPHP Coin developing a fully on-chain, smart contract-based DEX, where users can create, match, and cancel orders seamlessly. Unlike traditional exchanges, PHP Coin’s DEX will have no time limitations for orders, allowing users flexibility and control. Moreover, by replacing traditional gas fees with alternative mechanisms, PHP Coin offers a unique approach to handling transaction costs, creating a highly accessible and efficient trading platform.\r\n\r\nAs part of its commitment to multi-chain integration, PHP Coin recently launched a bridge to the Polygon network and is preparing to establish connection with other blockchains. This multi-chain approach allows users to seamlessly transfer their PHP Coins across different blockchain ecosystems, enhancing interoperability and providing more utility for their assets.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the importance of community, PHP Coin has established a campaign to raise awareness and attract support through user-generated content on social media. Through this campaign, supporters of PHP Coin are encouraged to create and share posts to engage others, promoting the project’s mission and values in an organic, user-centric way.\r\n\r\nPHP Coin prioritizes education and accessibility for new crypto enthusiasts. By providing informative content about the technology and its practical applications, PHP Coin helps users understand the benefits of blockchain while building a knowledgeable, engaged community.\r\n\r\nBuilt with the best security practices, PHP Coin utilizes industry-standard cryptographic protocols, such as ECDSA secp256k1, ensuring that all transactions and data on the network are safeguarded. The project also employs transparent practices, regularly sharing updates with its community to build trust and foster a long-term relationship with its supporters.\r\n\r\nPHP Coin encourages its community members to actively contribute to the project’s growth through social media campaigns and creative contributions. This community involvement strengthens the project’s reach and engagement without relying on traditional advertising methods, instead highlighting authentic user interest and endorsement.","de":"","es":"","fr":"","it":"","pl":"","ro":"","hu":"","nl":"","pt":"","sv":"","vi":"","tr":"","ru":"","ja":"","zh":"","zh-tw":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","id":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://phpcoin.net/"],"whitepaper":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zb3j1Gyz0i40Iydnt_1Bz532Jqxw-crpGAWZSqYeflg/edit?usp=sharing","blockchain_site":["https://main1.phpcoin.net/apps/explorer/"],"official_forum_url":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5371138.0"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/2H2YvFexQq","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjmOb_VPS7JcrIbTrp1_kwQ"],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"phpcoin","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"PHPcoincn","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/phpcoinn"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/34190/thumb/86735260.png?1704268343","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/34190/small/86735260.png?1704268343","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/34190/large/86735260.png?1704268343"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":194,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"ath_date":{},"atl":{},"atl_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"atl_date":{},"market_cap":{},"market_cap_rank":null,"fully_diluted_valuation":{},"market_cap_fdv_ratio":null,"total_volume":{},"high_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"low_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"price_change_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_7d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_14d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_30d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_60d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_200d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_1y":0.0,"market_cap_change_24h":null,"market_cap_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_1h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_24h_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_7d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_14d_in_currency":{},"price_change_percentage_30d_
