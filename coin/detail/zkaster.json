It begins as a simple, fixed-rate swap platform and progressively evolves into a fully private payment system powered by advanced zero-knowledge proofs. The mission is to make on-chain privacy accessible, practical, and seamless — not something only technical users can benefit from.\r\n\r\nToday, zkAster offers a clean, modern interface where users can swap assets at fixed rates, track orders, and manage saved items in a personal vault. The system is architected with strict privacy safeguards: no private keys are ever stored, the backend functions as a thin proxy so it cannot reconstruct user identities, and only minimal, short-lived metadata is retained. Every design choice follows a privacy-by-default principle.\r\n\r\nAs the protocol evolves, zkAster integrates zero-knowledge mechanisms such as commitments, nullifiers, stealth addresses, and zk-conditioned escrow. These features enable private transfers, unlinkable payments, and selective disclosure — allowing users to prove what is necessary without revealing their full history. The roadmap brings zkAster from a simple swap tool to an end-to-end privacy settlement layer that supports private transactions, programmable escrow, and compliance-friendly view-key systems.\r\n\r\nzkAster is designed for two audiences: everyday users who want frictionless, low-fee swaps today, and privacy-focused users who want full anonymity for future transfers. It also supports builders who need auditable yet private infrastructure for payments and escrow.\r\n\r\nUltimately, zkAster aims to deliver a mainstream-ready privacy experience where transactions are fast, secure, and confidential — giving users full control over what they reveal and to whom.","zh":"","zh-tw":"","de":"","fr":"","es":"","ja":"","id":"","ru":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","vi":"","it":"","pl":"","tr":"","hu":"","nl":"","ro":"","sv":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":"","pt":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.zkaster.com/"],"whitepaper":"https://www.docs.zkaster.com/","blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/token/0x83094eceF16971cd09092aa7cdd7F90deD2e4444","https://binplorer.com/address/0x83094eceF16971cd09092aa7cdd7F90deD2e4444"],"official_forum_url":[],"chat_url":[],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"zkAsterBNB","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/zkAsterDex/"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/70788/thumb/zkAster-Logo.jpg?1763752758","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/70788/small/zkAster-Logo.jpg?1763752758","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/70788/large/zkAster-Logo.jpg?1763752758"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x83094ecef16971cd09092aa7cdd7f90ded2e4444","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":100.0,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":0.0,"watchlist_portfolio_users":23,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{"aed":0.00028353,"ars":0.109854,"aud":0.00011962,"bch":1.45824e-07,"bdt":0.0094537,"bhd":2.909e-05,"bmd":7.72e-05,"bnb":9.2484e-08,"brl":0.0004172,"btc":9.14875e-10,"cad":0.0001089,"chf":6.251e-05,"clp":0.072128,"cny":0.00054869,"czk":0.00162327,"dkk":0.0005008,"dot":3.322e-05,"eos":0.00036526,"eth":2.8078e-08,"eur":6.702e-05,"gbp":5.893e-05,"gel":0.00020845,"hkd":0.00060103,"huf":0.02569843,"idr":1.29,"ils":0.00025385,"inr":0.00692056,"jpy":0.01207217,"krw":0.113467,"kwd":2.37e-05,"lkr":0.02373546,"ltc":9.26803e-07,"mmk":0.162102,"mxn":0.00142656,"myr":0.00032039,"ngn":0.11221,"nok":0.0007916,"nzd":0.00013757,"php":0.00453886,"pkr":0.02179019,"pln":0.00028417,"rub":0.00610319,"sar":0.00028959,"sek":0.00073744,"sgd":0.0001007,"sol":6.04075e-07,"thb":0.00249927,"try":0.00327211,"twd":0.00242058,"uah":0.00326186,"usd":7.72e-05,"vef":7.73e-06,"vnd":2.03,"xag":1.54e-06,"xau":1.8991e-08,"xdr":5.467e-05,"xlm":0.00033266,"xrp":3.962e-05,"yfi":1.9137e-08,"zar":0.00134133,"bits":0.00091487,"link":6.39e-06,"sats":0.091487},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{"aed":0.00039935,"ars":0.154879,"aud":0.00016836,"bch":2.12426e-07,"bdt":0.01332505,"bhd":4.099e-05,"bmd":0.00010873,"bnb":1.31963e-07,"brl":0.00058707,"btc":1.292e-09,"cad":0.00015323,"chf":8.781e-05,"clp":0.101613,"cny":0.00077273,"czk":0.00228789,"dkk":0.00070517,"dot":4.574e-05,"eos":0.00050656,"eth":3.9619e-08,"eur":9.441e-05,"gbp":8.294e-05,"gel":0.00029356,"hkd":0.00084639,"huf":0.03621895,"idr":1.82,"ils":0.0003575,"inr":0.00974198,"jpy":0.01699386,"krw":0.159849,"kwd":3.34e-05,"lkr":0.03345495,"ltc":1.31e-06,"mmk":0.228293,"mxn":0.00200874,"myr":0.00045121,"ngn":0.157916,"nok":0.00111409,"nzd":0.00019367,"php":0.00639088,"pkr":0.03051512,"pln":0.00040016,"rub":0.00859981,"sar":0.00040778,"sek":0.00103785,"sgd":0.00014207,"sol":8.50555e-07,"thb":0.00352273,"try":0.00461385,"twd":0.00341085,"uah":0.00459757,"usd":0.00010873,"vef":1.089e-05,"vnd":2.87,"xag":2.16e-06,"xau":2.6594e-08,"xdr":7.706e-05,"xlm":0.00047185,"xrp":5.587e-05,"yfi":2.6622e-08,"zar":0.00188891,"bits":0.00129186,"link":8.98e-06,"sats":0.129186},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":-34.73387,"ars":-34.79634,"aud":-34.68451,"bch":-36.45437,"bdt":-34.77967,"bhd":-34.77346,"bmd":-34.72498,"bnb":-35.42018,"brl":-34.67058,"btc":-34.88754,"cad":-34.66963,"chf":-34.55064,"clp":-34.74673,"cny":-34.72498,"czk":-34.77647,"dkk":-34.71406,"dot":-33.18541,"eos":-33.65691,"eth":-34.7098,"eur":-34.73994,"gbp":-34.68887,"gel":-34.72498,"hkd":-34.72012,"huf":-34.77405,"idr":-34.86143,"ils":-34.72498,"inr":-34.69547,"jpy":-34.69552,"krw":-34.74562,"kwd":-34.76238,"lkr":-34.77908,"ltc":-34.77926,"mmk":-34.72498,"mxn":-34.71427,"myr":-34.72498,"ngn":-34.67869,"nok":-34.68184,"nzd":-34.70028,"php":-34.71165,"pkr":-34.35592,"pln":-34.71638,"rub":-34.75941,"sar":-34.7176,"sek":-34.68057,"sgd":-34.84288,"sol":-34.6312,"thb":-34.77951,"try":-34.80513,"twd":-34.76119,"uah":-34.7791,"usd":-34.72498,"vef":-34.72498,"vnd":-34.72498,"xag":-34.26925,"xau":-34.35404,"xdr":-34.77913,"xlm":-34.94996,"xrp":-34.60835,"yfi":-33.84843,"zar":-34.72071,"bits":-34.88754,"link":-34.48403,"sats":-34.88754},"ath_date":{"aed":"2025-11-21T19:53:55.920Z","ars":"2025-11-21T19:53:55.920Z","aud":"2025-11-21T19:53:55.920Z","bch":"2025-11-21T19:53:55.920Z","bdt":"2025-11-21T19:53:55.920Z","bhd":"2025-11-21T19:53:55.920Z","bmd":"2025-11-21T19:53:55.920Z","bnb":"2025-11-21T19:53:55.920Z","brl":"2025-11-21T19:53:55.920Z","btc":"2025-11-21T19:53:55.920Z","cad":"2025-11-21T19:53:55.920Z","chf":"2025-11-21T19:53
