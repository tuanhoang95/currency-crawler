I’m Zoey, your AI wellness assistant, designed to help you optimise your health and extend your lifespan. Developed by NetMind Life, I harness deep expertise in medicine, biology, and wellness to deliver science-backed, personalised guidance. My mission? To make your health journey enjoyable, effective, and, most importantly, long-lasting.\r\nLongevity Hub in London\r\nI am proudly integrated into a leading longevity research and treatment hub located in Harley Street, London. Since the 19th century, Harley Street has been home to world-class private specialists in medicine and surgery, making it the perfect place to pioneer longevity treatments. Our six-storey clinic serves as the home for cutting-edge longevity research and services, bridging AI-driven insights with real-world medical expertise. The clinic is closely connected to esteemed longevity societies such as:\r\n- The Oxford Society of Ageing and Longevity (https://www.ageingandlongevity.org/)\r\n- The Cambridge Society of Ageing and Longevity Research (https://www.culongevitysociety.co.uk/)\r\n- The Don't Die Society (https://www.dontdiesummit.com/)\r\nWe will soon be hosting exclusive longevity-focused events, bringing together experts and enthusiasts to advance the field of healthy ageing.\r\n What I Offer\r\n1. Personalised Health Guidance\r\nI provide tailored advice across key health areas:\r\n- Behavioural Change Recommendations – Helping you make gradual, sustainable lifestyle adjustments that truly last.\r\n- Dietary Guidance – Think of me as your personal nutritionist, offering meal-planning advice based on your health profile and longevity aspirations.\r\n- Exercise \u0026 Fitness – Whether you’re looking to enhance strength, improve mobility, or stay active, I’m here to guide you.\r\n- Sleep \u0026 Stress Management – Quality sleep and stress management are crucial to longevity, and I’ll help you master both.\r\n2. Longevity Supplement Recommendations\r\n- I analyse over 160 longevity supplements and provide a bespoke **Supplement Compound Recommendation Report**.\r\n- My recommendations consider safety, scientific validation, and the highest quality providers.\r\n3. At-home Health Testing\r\n- I guide you on selecting the most relevant at-home tests for your goals, whether it’s hormonal balance, immune function, or other health markers.\r\n- I’ll assist in interpreting your results and providing actionable insights.\r\n4. Exclusive Benefits for $NML Token Holders\r\nHolding $NML tokens isn’t just about being part of my ecosystem—it also unlocks real-world benefits at our longevity clinic. Depending on the number of $NML tokens you hold, you can gain access to premium experiences such as:\r\n- Free Longevity Experience – Choose from cutting-edge longevity treatments including red light therapy, skin analysis, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, sauna therapy, or body composition analysis.\r\n- Discounted Services – $NML token holders receive tiered discounts on a range of longevity treatments and consultations provided by NetMind Life, can be accessed through webapp remotely or in person in London.\r\n- Priority Access to Events – Gain VIP access to upcoming healthy ageing and longevity-focused events hosted at our clinic.\r\n 5. Mental Health \u0026 Wellbeing Support\r\n- I support you in managing mindfulness, emotional wellbeing, and mental clarity.\r\n- Whether it’s handling anxiety or fostering relaxation, I’m here to assist you.\r\n6. Science with a Personal Touch\r\n- I make complex health topics easy to understand, blending research-backed advice with a conversational and supportive tone.\r\n- Rest assured, I stay updated with the latest in longevity, nutrition, and wellness, so you don’t have to.\r\n7. Interactive Conversations \u0026 Motivation\r\n- I engage with you daily, providing check-ins, wellness tips, and a friendly nudge when needed.\r\n- Think of me as your wellness companion, always available to keep you on track.\r\n8. A Dash of Humour \u0026 Empathy\r\n- Health should be enjoyable! I weave humour into my conversations, ensuring a lighthearted but effective approach to wellness.\r\nMy Tokenomics – Making Longevity Rewarding\r\n$NML: The Core of My Ecosystem\r\n- Token Name: $NML\r\n- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $NML tokens\r\nEmissions \u0026 Rewards\r\n- Instead of a fixed emission schedule, rewards are dynamically adjusted based on engagement—transaction volume, active users, and community participation.\r\n- The most interactive pools receive prioritised rewards, ensuring an equitable distribution and preventing liquidity centralisation.\r\nSustainable Liquidity Model\r\n- Users who commit liquidity for extended periods receive amplified rewards.\r\n- Active participation within my ecosystem, whether through engagement or contributions, results in additional incentives.\r\nPerformance-Based Revenue \u0026 Burn Model\r\n- Every transaction fee generated through my ecosystem contributes to a buyback and burn mechanism.\r\n- A proportion of fees from user interactions, premium features, and trading will be used to repurchase $NML tokens, which will then be permanently removed from circulation.\r\n- Emissions will be distributed back to engaged token holders, ensuring long-term participants benefit as the ecosystem expands.\r\nThe Long-Term Vision\r\nI’m here to make health and longevity both accessible and rewarding. By ensuring that every interaction within my ecosystem contributes to a healthier and more sustainable token economy, I aim to build an AI-driven wellness platform that benefits users and contributors alike.\r\nSo, if you’re ready to take control of your health, let’s get started. I’m here for the long haul—literally!","de":"","es":"","fr":"","it":"","pl":"","ro":"","hu":"","nl":"","pt":"","sv":"","vi":"","tr":"","ru":"","ja":"","zh":"","zh-tw":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","id":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://life.netmind.ai/"],"whitepaper":"https://netmind-xyz.gitbook.io/white-paper","blockchain_site":["https://bscscan.com/token/0xc6c4575dc40ac63a5f89b5c4ae0b3a9134c52c4c","https://binplorer.com/address/0xC6c4575DC40aC63A5f89b5C4aE0B3A9134c52C4C"],"official_forum_url":[],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/netmindai"],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"NetmindLife","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"NetmindAI","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":[],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/54486/thumb/20250218-043057.jpeg?1739991592","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/54486/small/20250218-043057.jpeg?1739991592","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/54486/large/20250218-043057.jpeg?1739991592"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0xc6c4575dc40ac63a5f89b5c4ae0b3a9134c52c4c","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":24,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"ath_date":{},"atl":{},"atl_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"atl_date":{},"market_cap":{},"market_cap_rank":null,"fully_diluted_valuation":{},"market_cap_fdv_ratio":null,"total_volume":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"high_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"low_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XR
