It simplifies BTC integration into DeFi while maximizing yield through innovative yield solutions  \r\n\r\nEcho's liquidity and aggregation solution enables users to deposit BTC of different standards, receive Echo's unified BTC and can interact with DeFi applications without relying on conventional Bitcoin staking protocols. Echo is seamlessly integrates with all native BTC Layer 2 solutions (Babylon, BSquared, Bitlayer) and supports various BTC liquid staking tokens (PumpBTC, LBTC) and wrapped BTC tokens (wBTC, fBTC). Echo also relies on Proof-of-Reserve to ensure that the BTC assets that are being accepted on Echo's aggregation layer are safe, secure and transparent.\r\n\r\nEcho LST infrastructure simplifies BTC integration into DeFi, ensuring pricing efficiency, depegging risk prevention, minimized slippage, and maximizing asset utilization for users across decentralized protocols.\r\n\r\nEcho is also building the first BTCFi hub on Move ecosystem to help users optimize and maximize their Bitcoin yields. Users can stake on Echo's Yield Layer to participate in various yield farming strategy to maximise returns based on the user's risk parameters. Echo provides yield optimization strategies like leveraged liquid staking, lending/borrowing, and eMSTR, which offers leveraged BTC positions without liquidation risk. Echo’s CeDeFi integration, leveraging Ceffu’s secure custody, allows for stable returns and additional yield generation.\r\n","de":"","es":"","fr":"","it":"","pl":"","ro":"","hu":"","nl":"","pt":"","sv":"","vi":"","tr":"","ru":"","ja":"","zh":"","zh-tw":"","ko":"","ar":"","th":"","id":"","cs":"","da":"","el":"","hi":"","no":"","sk":"","uk":"","he":"","fi":"","bg":"","hr":"","lt":"","sl":""},"links":{"homepage":["https://www.echo-protocol.xyz"],"whitepaper":"https://echo-protocol.gitbook.io/echo-protocol/echo-architecture/technical-architecture","blockchain_site":["https://explorer.movementlabs.xyz/fungible_asset/0x0b7400b60e249c92b6b97717e29915474d90eec3e8c510bf5675628367d39e35?network=mainnet","https://explorer.movementnetwork.xyz/fungible_asset/0x0b7400b60e249c92b6b97717e29915474d90eec3e8c510bf5675628367d39e35?network=mainnet"],"official_forum_url":[],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/echoprotocol","https://medium.com/@Echoprotocol"],"announcement_url":[],"snapshot_url":null,"twitter_screen_name":"EchoProtocol_","facebook_username":null,"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"+A-4noJ54900xNmI9","subreddit_url":null,"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/echo-proto"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/67853/thumb/mbtc-200px.png?1754063123","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/67853/small/mbtc-200px.png?1754063123","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/67853/large/mbtc-200px.png?1754063123"},"country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"contract_address":"0x0b7400b60e249c92b6b97717e29915474d90eec3e8c510bf5675628367d39e35","sentiment_votes_up_percentage":null,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":null,"watchlist_portfolio_users":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"market_data":{"current_price":{},"total_value_locked":null,"mcap_to_tvl_ratio":null,"fdv_to_tvl_ratio":null,"roi":null,"ath":{},"ath_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"ath_date":{},"atl":{},"atl_change_percentage":{"aed":0.0,"ars":0.0,"aud":0.0,"bch":0.0,"bdt":0.0,"bhd":0.0,"bmd":0.0,"bnb":0.0,"brl":0.0,"btc":0.0,"cad":0.0,"chf":0.0,"clp":0.0,"cny":0.0,"czk":0.0,"dkk":0.0,"dot":0.0,"eos":0.0,"eth":0.0,"eur":0.0,"gbp":0.0,"gel":0.0,"hkd":0.0,"huf":0.0,"idr":0.0,"ils":0.0,"inr":0.0,"jpy":0.0,"krw":0.0,"kwd":0.0,"lkr":0.0,"ltc":0.0,"mmk":0.0,"mxn":0.0,"myr":0.0,"ngn":0.0,"nok":0.0,"nzd":0.0,"php":0.0,"pkr":0.0,"pln":0.0,"rub":0.0,"sar":0.0,"sek":0.0,"sgd":0.0,"sol":0.0,"thb":0.0,"try":0.0,"twd":0.0,"uah":0.0,"usd":0.0,"vef":0.0,"vnd":0.0,"xag":0.0,"xau":0.0,"xdr":0.0,"xlm":0.0,"xrp":0.0,"yfi":0.0,"zar":0.0,"bits":0.0,"link":0.0,"sats":0.0},"atl_date":{},"market_cap":{},"market_cap_rank":null,"fully_diluted_valuation":{},"market_cap_fdv_ratio":null,"total_volume":{},"high_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"low_24h":{"AED":null,"ARS":null,"AUD":null,"BCH":null,"BDT":null,"BHD":null,"BMD":null,"BNB":null,"BRL":null,"BTC":null,"CAD":null,"CHF":null,"CLP":null,"CNY":null,"CZK":null,"DKK":null,"DOT":null,"EOS":null,"ETH":null,"EUR":null,"GBP":null,"GEL":null,"HKD":null,"HUF":null,"IDR":null,"ILS":null,"INR":null,"JPY":null,"KRW":null,"KWD":null,"LKR":null,"LTC":null,"MMK":null,"MXN":null,"MYR":null,"NGN":null,"NOK":null,"NZD":null,"PHP":null,"PKR":null,"PLN":null,"RUB":null,"SAR":null,"SEK":null,"SGD":null,"SOL":null,"THB":null,"TRY":null,"TWD":null,"UAH":null,"USD":null,"VEF":null,"VND":null,"XAG":null,"XAU":null,"XDR":null,"XLM":null,"XRP":null,"YFI":null,"ZAR":null,"BITS":null,"LINK":null,"SATS":null},"price_change_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_24h":null,"price_change_percentage_7d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_14d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_30d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_60d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_200d":0.0,"price_change_percentage_1y":0.0,"market_cap_change_24h":null,"market_cap_cha
